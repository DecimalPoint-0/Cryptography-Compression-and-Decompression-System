2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

ey Some records remain safe over time d) Application Records are easily accessible

d) It involves no or less of paperwork and data processing is very fast

e) The environment is user

f) It takes a short time for mistakes to be rectified

2.2 REVIEW OF RELATED WORKS

Ibrahim Al-Mahdi (2015), stated that the internet has been a source of medical information, it has been used for Online Medical Consultation (OMC). OMC is now offered by many providers internationally with diverse models and features. In OMC, consultations and treatments are available 24/7.

Sara Shaw (2016), reported that there is a strong policy drive towards implementing alternatives to face to face consultations in general practice to improve access, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. These alternatives embrace novel technologies that are assumed to offer potential to improve care Aim: To explore the introduction of one online consultation system (Tele-Doc) and how it shapes working practices Design and setting: Mixed methods case study in an inner-city general practice. Method The study was conducted through interviews with IT developers, clinicians, and administrative staff, and scrutiny of documents, websites, and demonstrator versions of Tele-Doe, followed by thematic analysis and discourse analysis. Results: Three interrelated themes were identified online consultation systems as innovation. managing the 'messiness' of general practice consultations, and redistribution of the work of general practice. These themes raise timely questions about what it means to consult in contemporary general practice Uptake of Tele-Doc by patients was low. Much of the work of the consultation was redistributed to patients and administrators, sometimes causing misunderstandings. The 'messiness' of consultations was hard to eliminate. In-house training focused on the technical application rather than associated transformations to practice work that were not anticipated. GPs welcomed varied modes of consulting, but the aspiration of improved efficiency was not realised in practice Conclusion: Tele-Doc offers a new kind of consultation that is still being worked out in practice. It may offer convenience for patients with discrete, single problems, and a welcome variation to GPs workload. Tele-Doc's potential for addressing more complex problems and achieving efficiency is less clear, and its adoption may involve unforeseeable consequences.

The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

ey Some records remain safe over time d) Application Records are easily accessible

d) It involves no or less of paperwork and data processing is very fast

e) The environment is user

f) It takes a short time for mistakes to be rectified

2.2 REVIEW OF RELATED WORKS

Sara Shaw (2016), reported that there is a strong policy drive towards implementing alternatives to face to face consultations in general practice to improve access, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. These alternatives embrace novel technologies that are assumed to offer potential to improve care Aim: To explore the introduction of one online consultation system (Tele-Doc) and how it shapes working practices Design and setting: Mixed methods case study in an inner-city general practice. Method The study was conducted through interviews with IT developers, clinicians, and administrative staff, and scrutiny of documents, websites, and demonstrator versions of Tele-Doe, followed by thematic analysis and discourse analysis. Results: Three interrelated themes were identified online consultation systems as innovation. managing the 'messiness' of general practice consultations, and redistribution of the work of general practice. These themes raise timely questions about what it means to consult in contemporary general practice Uptake of Tele-Doc by patients was low. Much of the work of the consultation was redistributed to patients and administrators, sometimes causing misunderstandings. The 'messiness' of consultations was hard to eliminate. In-house training focused on the technical application rather than associated transformations to practice work that were not anticipated. GPs welcomed varied modes of consulting, but the aspiration of improved efficiency was not realised in practice Conclusion: Tele-Doc offers a new kind of consultation that is still being worked out in practice. It may offer convenience for patients with discrete, single problems, and a welcome variation to GPs workload. Tele-Doc's potential for addressing more complex problems and achieving efficiency is less clear, and its adoption may involve unforeseeable consequences.

LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

ey Some records remain safe over time d) Application Records are easily accessible

d) It involves no or less of paperwork and data processing is very fast

e) The environment is user

f) It takes a short time for mistakes to be rectified

2.2 REVIEW OF RELATED WORKS

Ibrahim Al-Mahdi (2015), stated that the internet has been a source of medical information, it has been used for Online Medical Consultation (OMC). OMC is now offered by many providers internationally with diverse models and features. In OMC, consultations and treatments are available 24/7.

Sara Shaw (2016), reported that there is a strong policy drive towards implementing alternatives to face to face consultations in general practice to improve access, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. These alternatives embrace novel technologies that are assumed to offer potential to improve care Aim: To explore the introduction of one online consultation system (Tele-Doc) and how it shapes working practices Design and setting: Mixed methods case study in an inner-city general practice. Method The study was conducted through interviews with IT developers, clinicians, and administrative staff, and scrutiny of documents, websites, and demonstrator versions of Tele-Doe, followed by thematic analysis and discourse analysis. Results: Three interrelated themes were identified online consultation systems as innovation. managing the 'messiness' of general practice consultations, and redistribution of the work of general practice. These themes raise timely questions about what it means to consult in contemporary general practice Uptake of Tele-Doc by patients was low. Much of the work of the consultation was redistributed to patients and administrators, sometimes causing misunderstandings. The 'messiness' of consultations was hard to eliminate. In-house training focused on the technical application rather than associated transformations to practice work that were not anticipated. GPs welcomed varied modes of consulting, but the aspiration of improved efficiency was not realised in practice Conclusion: Tele-Doc offers a new kind of consultation that is still being worked out in practice. It may offer convenience for patients with discrete, single problems, and a welcome variation to GPs workload. Tele-Doc's potential for addressing more complex problems and achieving efficiency is less clear, and its adoption may involve unforeseeable consequences.

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.

The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

ey Some records remain safe over time d) Application Records are easily accessible

d) It involves no or less of paperwork and data processing is very fast

e) The environment is user

f) It takes a short time for mistakes to be rectified

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization

Sara Shaw (2016), reported that there is a strong policy drive towards implementing alternatives to face to face consultations in general practice to improve access, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. These alternatives embrace novel technologies that are assumed to offer potential to improve care Aim: To explore the introduction of one online consultation system (Tele-Doc) and how it shapes working practices Design and setting: Mixed methods case study in an inner-city general practice. Method The study was conducted through interviews with IT developers, clinicians, and administrative staff, and scrutiny of documents, websites, and demonstrator versions of Tele-Doe, followed by thematic analysis and discourse analysis. Results: Three interrelated themes were identified online consultation systems as innovation. managing the 'messiness' of general practice consultations, and redistribution of the work of general practice. These themes raise timely questions about what it means to consult in contemporary general practice Uptake of Tele-Doc by patients was low. Much of the work of the consultation was redistributed to patients and administrators, sometimes causing misunderstandings. The 'messiness' of consultations was hard to eliminate. In-house training focused on the technical application rather than associated transformations to practice work that were not anticipated.

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

ey Some records remain safe over time d) Application Records are easily accessible

d) It involves no or less of paperwork and data processing is very fast

e) The environment is user

f) It takes a short time for mistakes to be rectified

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

ey Some records remain safe over time d) Application Records are easily accessible

d) It involves no or less of paperwork and data processing is very fast

e) The environment is user

f) It takes a short time for mistakes to be rectified

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

d) It involves no or less of paperwork and data processing is very fast

e) The environment is user

f) It takes a short time for mistakes to be rectified

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

ey Some records remain safe over time d) Application Records are easily accessible

d) It involves no or less of paperwork and data processing is very fast

e) The environment is user

f) It takes a short time for mistakes to be rectified

2.2 REVIEW OF RELATED WORKS

Ibrahim Al-Mahdi (2015), stated that the internet has been a source of medical information, it has been used for Online Medical Consultation (OMC). OMC is now offered by many providers internationally with diverse models and features. In OMC, consultations and treatments are available 24/7. The covid-19 pandemic across-the-board, many people unable to go to hospital or clinic because the spread of the virus. This paper tried to answer two research questions.

Sara Shaw (2016), reported that there is a strong policy drive towards implementing alternatives to face to face consultations in general practice to improve access, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. These alternatives embrace novel technologies that are assumed to offer potential to improve care Aim: To explore the introduction of one online consultation system (Tele-Doc) and how it shapes working practices Design and setting: Mixed methods case study in an inner-city general practice. Method The study was conducted through interviews with IT developers, clinicians, and administrative staff, and scrutiny of documents, websites, and demonstrator versions of Tele-Doe, followed by thematic analysis and discourse analysis. Results: Three interrelated themes were identified online consultation systems as innovation. managing the 'messiness' of general practice consultations, and redistribution of the work of general practice. These themes raise timely questions about what it means to consult in contemporary general practice Uptake of Tele-Doc by patients was low. Much of the work of the consultation was redistributed to patients and administrators, sometimes causing misunderstandings. The 'messiness' of consultations was hard to eliminate. In-house training focused on the technical application rather than associated transformations to practice work that were not anticipated. GPs welcomed varied modes of consulting, but the aspiration of improved efficiency was not realised in practice Conclusion: Tele-Doc offers a new kind of consultation that is still being worked out in practice. It may offer convenience for patients with discrete, single problems, and a welcome variation to GPs workload. Tele-Doc's potential for addressing more complex problems and achieving efficiency is less clear, and its adoption may involve unforeseeable consequences.

The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

ey Some records remain safe over time d) Application Records are easily accessible

d) It involves no or less of paperwork and data processing is very fast

e) The environment is user

f) It takes a short time for mistakes to be rectified

2.2 REVIEW OF RELATED WORKS

Sara Shaw (2016), reported that there is a strong policy drive towards implementing alternatives to face to face consultations in general practice to improve access, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. These alternatives embrace novel technologies that are assumed to offer potential to improve care Aim: To explore the introduction of one online consultation system (Tele-Doc) and how it shapes working practices Design and setting: Mixed methods case study in an inner-city general practice. Method The study was conducted through interviews with IT developers, clinicians, and administrative staff, and scrutiny of documents, websites, and demonstrator versions of Tele-Doe, followed by thematic analysis and discourse analysis. Results: Three interrelated themes were identified online consultation systems as innovation. managing the 'messiness' of general practice consultations, and redistribution of the work of general practice. These themes raise timely questions about what it means to consult in contemporary general practice Uptake of Tele-Doc by patients was low. Much of the work of the consultation was redistributed to patients and administrators, sometimes causing misunderstandings. The 'messiness' of consultations was hard to eliminate. In-house training focused on the technical application rather than associated transformations to practice work that were not anticipated. GPs welcomed varied modes of consulting, but the aspiration of improved efficiency was not realised in practice Conclusion: Tele-Doc offers a new kind of consultation that is still being worked out in practice. It may offer convenience for patients with discrete, single problems, and a welcome variation to GPs workload. Tele-Doc's potential for addressing more complex problems and achieving efficiency is less clear, and its adoption may involve unforeseeable consequences.

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment.

Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

ey Some records remain safe over time d) Application Records are easily accessible

d) It involves no or less of paperwork and data processing is very fast

e) The environment is user

f) It takes a short time for mistakes to be rectified

2.2 REVIEW OF RELATED WORKS

Ibrahim Al-Mahdi (2015), stated that the internet has been a source of medical information, it has been used for Online Medical Consultation (OMC). OMC is now offered by many providers internationally with diverse models and features. In OMC, consultations and treatments are available 24/7.

Sara Shaw (2016), reported that there is a strong policy drive towards implementing alternatives to face to face consultations in general practice to improve access, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. These alternatives embrace novel technologies that are assumed to offer potential to improve care Aim: To explore the introduction of one online consultation system (Tele-Doc) and how it shapes working practices Design and setting: Mixed methods case study in an inner-city general practice. Method The study was conducted through interviews with IT developers, clinicians, and administrative staff, and scrutiny of documents, websites, and demonstrator versions of Tele-Doe, followed by thematic analysis and discourse analysis. Results: Three interrelated themes were identified online consultation systems as innovation. managing the 'messiness' of general practice consultations, and redistribution of the work of general practice. These themes raise timely questions about what it means to consult in contemporary general practice Uptake of Tele-Doc by patients was low. Much of the work of the consultation was redistributed to patients and administrators, sometimes causing misunderstandings. The 'messiness' of consultations was hard to eliminate. In-house training focused on the technical application rather than associated transformations to practice work that were not anticipated. GPs welcomed varied modes of consulting, but the aspiration of improved efficiency was not realised in practice Conclusion: Tele-Doc offers a new kind of consultation that is still being worked out in practice. It may offer convenience for patients with discrete, single problems, and a welcome variation to GPs workload. Tele-Doc's potential for addressing more complex problems and achieving efficiency is less clear, and its adoption may involve unforeseeable consequences.

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.

The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

ey Some records remain safe over time d) Application Records are easily accessible

d) It involves no or less of paperwork and data processing is very fast

e) The environment is user

f) It takes a short time for mistakes to be rectified

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization

Sara Shaw (2016), reported that there is a strong policy drive towards implementing alternatives to face to face consultations in general practice to improve access, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. These alternatives embrace novel technologies that are assumed to offer potential to improve care Aim: To explore the introduction of one online consultation system (Tele-Doc) and how it shapes working practices Design and setting: Mixed methods case study in an inner-city general practice. Method The study was conducted through interviews with IT developers, clinicians, and administrative staff, and scrutiny of documents, websites, and demonstrator versions of Tele-Doe, followed by thematic analysis and discourse analysis. Results: Three interrelated themes were identified online consultation systems as innovation. managing the 'messiness' of general practice consultations, and redistribution of the work of general practice. These themes raise timely questions about what it means to consult in contemporary general practice Uptake of Tele-Doc by patients was low. Much of the work of the consultation was redistributed to patients and administrators, sometimes causing misunderstandings. The 'messiness' of consultations was hard to eliminate. In-house training focused on the technical application rather than associated transformations to practice work that were not anticipated.

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

ey Some records remain safe over time d) Application Records are easily accessible

d) It involves no or less of paperwork and data processing is very fast

e) The environment is user

f) It takes a short time for mistakes to be rectified

2.1.5	 THE LAND MANAGEMENT PARADIGM
The Land Management Paradigm: Enemark (2014) stated that Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put into good effect (UN-ECE 2014). Land management encompasses all activities associated with the management of land and natural resources that are required to achieve sustainable development. The concept of land includes properties and natural resources and thereby encompasses the total natural and build environment. The organizational structures for land management differ widely between countries and regions throughout the world, and reflect local cultural and judicial settings. The institutional arrangements may change over time to better support the implementation of land policies and good governance
Within this country context, the land management activities may be described by the three components: Land Policies, Land Information Infrastructures, and Land Administration Functions in support of Sustainable Development Land policy is part of the national policy on promoting objectives including economic development, social justice and equity, and political stability. Land policies may be associated with: security of tenure, land markets (particularly land transactions and access to credit), real property taxation, sustainable management and control of land use, natural resources and the environment, the provision of land for the poor, ethnic minorities and women; and measures to prevent land speculation and to manage land disputes.
The operational component of the land management paradigm is the range of land administration functions that ensure proper management of rights, restrictions, responsibilities and risks in relation to property, land and natural resources. These functions include the areas of land tenure (securing and transferring rights in land and natural resources), land value (valuation and taxation of land and properties), land use (planning and control of the use of land and natural resources); and land development (implementing utilities, infrastructure and construction planning)
The land administration functions are based on and are facilitated by appropriate land information infrastructures that include cadastral and topographic datasets and provide access to complete and up-to-date information about the built and natural environment. Sound land management is the operational processes of implementing land policies in comprehensive and sustainable ways. In many countries, however, there is a tendency to separate land tenure rights form the land user rights. There is then no effective institutional mechanism for linking planning and land use controls with land values and the operation of the land market. These problems are often compounded by poor administrative and management procedures that fail to deliver required services. Investment in new technology will only go a small way towards solving a much deeper problem: the failure to treat land and its resources as a coherent whole.
2.1.6 	LAND ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS
LAS, and particularly their core cadastral components, are important infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of land policies in both developed and developing countries LAS are concerned with the social, legal, economic and technical framework within which land managers and administrators must operate (UNECE 2015) These systems support efficient land markets and are, at the same time, concerned with the administration of land as a natural resource to ensure its sustainable development.
Land administration comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to manage Land Tenure: The allocation and security of rights in land, the legal surveys to determine parcel boundaries, the transfer of property or use from one party to another through sale or lease, the management and adjudication of doubts and disputes regarding rights and parcel boundaries.
Land Value: The assessment of the value of land and properties, the gathering of revenues through taxation, the management and adjudication of land valuation and taxation disputes
Land Use: the control of land use through adoption of planning policies and land use regulations at national, regional and local levels, the enforcement of land use regulations, and the management and adjudication of land use conflicts.
Land Development: The building of new physical infrastructure, the implementation of construction planning and change of land use through planning permission and granting permits.
These systems are interrelated. The actual economic and physical use of land and properties influence land value Land value is also influenced by the possible future use of land as determined through zoning, land use planning regulations and permit granting processes. And the land use planning and policies will, of course, determine and regulate future land development. The information on land and properties permeates through the system and provides the basic infrastructure for running the interrelated systems within the four interrelated areas. The land information area should be organised to combine cadastral and topographic data and thereby link the built environment (including legal land rights) with the natural environment (including environmental and natural resource issues). Land information should, this way, be organised as a spatial data infrastructure at national, regional/federal and local level based on relevant policies for data sharing, cost recovery, access to data, standards, etc
The design of adequate systems in the area of land tenure and land value should lead to the establishment of an efficient land market capable of supporting trading in complex commodities. The design of adequate systems in the areas of land use control and land development should lead to effective land-use management. The combination of an efficient land market and effective land use management should then form the basis for a sustainable approach to economic, social and environmental development.
2.1.4	 INFORMATION SYSTEM
With cognizance to Buckingham (2015), An Information System can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. Basically an Information System handles the flow and maintenance of Information that supports a business or some other operation. It contains information about significant people, places and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it Information is derived from meaningful interpretation of data.
A system which assembles, stores, processes, and delivers information relevant to an organization (or to a society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens: An information system is a human activity (social) system, which may or may not involve the use of computer systems Also, in addition to supporting decision-making, information systems help workers and managers to analyze complex problems, to develop new products and to integrate the various modules and departments. Moreover the transmission losses inter-departmental communication are reduced considerably leading to better coordination and improved transparency (information sharing) within the organization as a whole.

2.1.6 	FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
According to Laudon and Laudon (2018). Three activities provide the information that organizations need. These activities are Input, Processing and Output. 'Input consists of acquisition of the raw data', which is transformed into more meaningful packets of 'Information' by means of Processing The processed information now flows to the users or activities also called as 'Output. The shortcomings are analyzed and the information is sent back to the appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate and refine the input This is termed as 'feedback'.
Examples of 'Information Inputs would be Transactions, events which would undergo 'processing' in the form of sorting, listing, merging and updating resulting in 'outputs' such as detailed reports, lists and summaries Another example would be in the manufacturing environment with information inputs such as design spees material requirements and the SOPs (standard operating procedures). These would be 'processed by the information system by modeling and simulation techniques and would result in standard production models along with the overall cost of the production process which is calculated by the information system from the knowledge base containing material costs, hourly labor costs and other indirect costs, hence, almost totally eliminating a distinct costing function in the scheme of things.
However an information system cannot just be broadly described as an Input-Process-output mechanism in vacuum. It is required to provide major organizational solutions to challenges and problems posed in the business environment. Hence a manager needs to be not just computer-literate but also have a good idea of the organizational structure and functions as n whole

Also, at the heart of the issue, Information systems should not be confused with information technology They exist independent of each other and irrespective of whether they are implemented well Information systems use computers (or Information Technology) as tools for the storing and rapid processing of information leading to analysis, decision-making and better coordination and control Hence information technology forms the basis of modern

information systems 2.1.7 TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

According to Laudon (2013), the purpose of computer-based information systems is to provide managers and various categories of employees with the appropriate kind of information to help them make decisions. The six major types of information systems corresponding to each organizational level are 1. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) serve the operational level of an organization
conduct business. It records day-to-day transactions such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production output. It also helps to generate databases that act as the foundation for the other information systems

2 Decision-support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that provides a flexible tool for data analysis. It helps in predicting changes that may influence the data in the future. It simply analyzes data. It helps to analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends outside an organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction processing system

3 Management information systems (MIS) serve the management level of the organization. It is a computer-based information system that produces standardized reports in

a summarized structured form.

2.1.8 POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES

Computerization refers to using computer to perform operations, which were originally performed manually or sub-mechanically. A web based (client-server) design technique was chosen so as to help users and the management to effectively use the system without having to

visit a physical location

After conducting the investigation the advantages or benefits of the proposed web system are a) The system can disseminate information or record by its self or without human help.

as follows:

b) Application of land and shop consumes little of time and manpower.

ey Some records remain safe over time d) Application Records are easily accessible

d) It involves no or less of paperwork and data processing is very fast

e) The environment is user

f) It takes a short time for mistakes to be rectified

These themes raise timely questions about what it means to consult in contemporary general practice Uptake of Tele-Doc by patients was low. Much of the work of the consultation was redistributed to patients and administrators, sometimes causing misunderstandings. The 'messiness' of consultations was hard to eliminate. In-house training focused on the technical application rather than associated transformations to practice work that were not anticipated. GPs welcomed varied modes of consulting, but the aspiration of improved efficiency was not realised in practice Conclusion: Tele-Doc offers a new kind of consultation that is still being worked out in practice. It may offer convenience for patients with discrete, single problems, and a welcome variation to GPs workload. Tele-Doc's potential for addressing more complex problems and achieving efficiency is less clear, and its adoption may involve unforeseeable consequences.
